My attempt at a voice translator

### How it works
- Recorded in 5 second snippits
- seamless model is used to capture the users voice and turn it into text
- then there is a grammar checker that corrects mistakes that the seamless model might have made
- then the text is processed and spoken outloud

### Notes
- Thought that using seamless to generate the text was a good idea but it randomly prints out stuff sometimes and slows down the script
- better text to voice is needed in the future
- Whisper, deepL, openAI api keys would make this way better
